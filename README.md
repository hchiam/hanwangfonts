# Han Wang Zhuyin Fonts

This project is an archive of the free HanWang font family, Chinese (Unicode) TrueType fonts by Dr. Hann-Tzong Wang.

The only existing copies of this font online are hard to find, and may disappear, so I've created this Github copy for safe keeping.

This font family is extremely useful for using Traditional Chinese in Taiwan along with Zhuyin/Bopomofo.
